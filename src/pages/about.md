Hello! I'm Aashish.

I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on backend systems and applied AI, experienced in building production-grade services using Java, Python, and TypeScript. I enjoy solving structured, real-world problems, working end-to-end on systems from design to deployment, and continuously improving how software is built and scaled. Outside of work, I like staying hands-on with new tech, reading, and skateboarding.
